## Funding

We received a grant from Columbia University and Stanford University through their Brown Institute for Media Innovation: https://brown.columbia.edu/22-23-magic/

## Legal Status

We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation -- the One Fact Foundation -- headquartered in New York City.

## Plan

Now we are working with dolthub.com to link negotiated rates with prices at every one of 7000+ hospitals in the United States. 

We are conducting user research in disadvantaged areas (as measured by household income below $50,000 and at least one household member on Medicaid health insurance), starting in New York before expanding nationwide:

The roadmap is here: https://github.com/orgs/onefact/projects/2 

## Key Performance Indicator

Our KPI is the median price of hospital procedures, treatments, medications in the United States across all negotiated rates and hospital prices. If this decreases every quarter, we get promoted.

## Talk

We got to give a talk at an NIH conference called aim-ahead.net recently on the state of the US healthcare system, and what we can do about it: https://bit.ly/onefact-keynote
