  ### Payless Health {% .jumbo %}

  [Payless.health](https://payless.health) is a search engine and open database of all hospital prices in the United States. We are currently running a [data bounty](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-10-28-announcing-hospital-urls/) and paying up to $10,000 for help collecting this data that is public by federal law.

  Payless Health is open source so you can trust it; most electronic health records in the United States are closed.

### Payless Health is powered by AI {% .jumbo %}

The One Fact Foundation created Payless Health using the same tools that Google uses to power its search engine. We are prototyping this search engine in communities across the country, and analyzing millions of gigabytes of data from hospitals and insurance companies.
